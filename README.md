## Quickstart

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
unflappable = "0.2"
```

Create an uninitialized [`Debouncer`] in static storage.

```rust
use unflappable::{debouncer_uninit, Debouncer, default::ActiveLow};
static DEBOUNCER: Debouncer<PinType, ActiveLow> = debouncer_uninit!();
```

Initialize the `Debouncer` with your input pin, returning the
[`Debounced`] pin.  Use this pin just as you would any other
[`InputPin`], such as passing ownership to another abstraction.

```rust
let debounced_pin = unsafe { DEBOUNCER.init(input_pin) }?;
```

Regularly poll the `Debouncer`, perhaps in an interrupt service routine.

```rust
unsafe {
    DEBOUNCER.poll()?;
}
```

## Comparison to other debounce crates

There are at least three debouncing crates targeting embedded Rust
development.  How does this one compare to the others?

- Crate: `unflappable`
  - Wraps `InputPin`: **Yes**
  - Can move wrapped pin: **Yes**
  - Algorithm: Integration-based by [Kuhn]
  - State overhead: `u8`
- Crate: [`debounced-pin`]
  - Wraps `InputPin`: **Yes**
  - Can move wrapped pin: No
  - Algorithm: Differentiation-based by [Greensted]
  - State overhead: `u8` + `enum`
- Crate: [`bounced`]
  - Wraps `InputPin`: No
  - Can move wrapped pin: N/A
  - Algorithm: configurable
    - Integration-based similar to [Kuhn]
    - State overhead: 2 * `u8`
    - Shifting-based
    - State overhead: 2 ^ `u8`
- Crate: [`debouncr`]
  - Wraps `InputPin`: No
  - Can move wrapped pin: N/A
  - Algorithm: Differentiation-based by [Ganssle]
  - State overhead: `u8`
- Crate: [`debouncing`]
  - Wraps `InputPin`: No
  - Can move wrapped pin: N/A
  - Algorithm: Differentiation-based by [Hackaday]
  - State overhead: `u8` + dynamically-allocated `Vec`
